a constant to multiply.

        sum from xmin to infinity of ( x^(-alpha) * e^(-lam x)] ) =
        e^(-xmin * lam) * HurwitzLerchPhi(e^(-lam), alpha, xmin)

        Phi(z,s,a) = sum from 0 to infinity of ( z^k / (a+k)^s )

    (as defined in sympy docs). If one is disinclined to note this fact
    by deriving it, one is encouraged to look at it in Mathematica and
    blindly trust the result.

    Note: The standard notation for the Lerch Phi function above uses "a" as
          a parameter. This does not correspond to the alpha we pass to the
          function.
